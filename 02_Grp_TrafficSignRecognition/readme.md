## 1. Introduction

* Traffic sign detection and classification is an important technology, as it helps drivers in
understanding signs and following traffic rules, as well as contributing to the development of
autonomous driving systems.
* This project is based on the state of the art object detection network, convolutional neural network.
* This projet is capable enought to detect 43 traffic signal generally used at roadside.

## 2. Members
* [Vivek Pandey](https://github.com/vivek0455) --*Responsible for implemention, Bugs fixing and GUI*
* [Tehreem Arshad]( ) -- *Generally work on architecture of CNN Model*
* [Shristi Kashyap]( ) --*Documentation, bugs fixes and GUI*

## 3. Roadmap

*  The whole system can be modeled as the figure below. It consists of four stages, namely image input, pre-processing , detection, classification and result.

## 4. Estimation

The collected data, divided it into three datasets, including training, validating, and testing. The face recognition accuracy and loss is schematically drawn in figure.
